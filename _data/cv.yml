    I am interested in the intersection of image analysis and cultural heritage. In particular, this involves developing bespoke models and methods tailored to the multi-modal and multi-domain imaging data encountered in heritage science. Among other projects, some focuses in my research are: <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Visualizing features of paintings (e.g. artist sketches) using hyperspectral data. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Generalizing neural-network to classifying imprints common in medieval Italian gold-ground paintings. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Reconstructing music manuscripts with multi-spectral image processing. <br>
