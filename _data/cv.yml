  contents:
    - I am interested in the intersection of image analysis and cultural heritage. In particular, this involves developing bespoke models and methods tailored to the multi-modal and multi-domain imaging data encountered in heritage science. Among other projects, my research has the following larger efforts
      - Visualizing features of paintings (e.g. artist sketches) using hyperspectral data.
      - Generalizing neural-network to classifying imprints common in medieval Italian gold-ground paintings.
      - Reconstructing music manuscripts with multi-spectral image processing.
