ARTICT, from the project Art Through the ICT Lens: Big Data Processing Tools to Support the Technical Study, Preservation and Conservation of Old Master Paintings, is an effort funded by [EPSRC](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/R032785/1) of [UKRI​](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FR032785%2F1).

ARTICT is a wonderful collaboration where I began with applied mathematics and cultural heritage, inspiring the path that lead to my PhD and current reserach focus. Learn more on the [project webpage](https://art-ict.github.io/artict/home.html)!
