In this project, we explore how punch marks, small impressions made in the gold leaf of paintinggs, can be automatically classified with AI methods. One challenge is generalization, learning punch marks on some paintings and correctly identifying them in others. This leads to a domain generalization problem that is further explored in our [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1296207425000135) {% cite peaslee2025punchmarks %}.
