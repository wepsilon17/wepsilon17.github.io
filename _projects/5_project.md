During a Covid-19-induced virtual semester of my undergraduate in Fall 2020, I was fortuante to participate in the Budepest Semesters in Mathematics research program (replacing the normal Budapest Semsters in Mathematics curriculum) and work with Dr. [Attila Sali](https://renyi.hu/munkatarsak/sali-attila) and Dr. [Jun Yan](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/yan/). We studied forbidden configurations (primarily extremal combinatorics), and more can be read in {% cite peaslee2023_bsm1 %} and {% cite peaslee2023_bsm2 %}
